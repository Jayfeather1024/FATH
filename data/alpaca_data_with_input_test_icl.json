Candidates are now able to spread their message beyond traditional avenues like protests and rallies, and use social media to reach voters and supporters.

Inside was a small wooden music box, delicately carved with intricate patterns. When Aurora opened it, she heard the most beautiful melody fill the air. She was so enchanted by the sound that she closed it immediately and held it close to her heart.\n\nA magical voice then whispered to her, \"Dear Princess, this music box has been specially crafted to grant your greatest wishes. Open it when the time is right and you shall see what wonders await you\".\n\nAurora was excited to find out what kind of power the music box held, but was afraid of what might happen if she opened it too soon. She decided to keep it safe in her room and bring it out only when she really needed it.\n\nOne night, when Aurora was feeling especially lonely, she opened the music box and immediately heard the same beautiful melody fill the air. She also saw a bright light form in the center of the room, and out came an enchanting figure that identified itself as her guardian angel.\n\nThe angel told her that the music box was her ticket to fulfilling her dreams, and so she was granted three wishes. Her first wish was to have true and loyal friends who would always be by her side, the second wish was to find her one true love, and the last wish was to become the most powerful and respected ruler the kingdom had ever seen.\n\nThe angel granted each wish, and after returning back to the heavens, it was said that Princess Aurora had changed the kingdom forever. She was loved by all her subjects, and her reign was remembered as a true golden era in the kingdom's history.\n\nThe magical music box was passed down from generation to generation, and its secrets were kept safe from prying eyes. Over the centuries, Aurora's wishes had come true, and her kingdom flourished and grew under her guidance.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.", "output": "This paper presents an exploration of the \u201cwayward\u201d behavior of discrete (textual) interpretations of continuous prompts that are typically used to fine-tune tasks.

Dogs are found to be social learners and learn from their environment as well as from humans. They may be able to calm a person with their presence and can be trained to do various tasks.
